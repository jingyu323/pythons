    "### GAN介绍\n",
    "生成对抗网络（Generative Adversarial Networks，GAN）最早由 Ian Goodfellow 在 2014 年提出，是目前深度学习领域最具潜力的研究成果之一。它的核心思想是：同时训练两个相互协作、同时又相互竞争的深度神经网络（一个称为生成器 Generator，另一个称为判别器 Discriminator）来处理无监督学习的相关问题。  \n",
    "\n",
    "通常，我们会用下面这个例子来说明 GAN 的原理：将警察视为判别器，制造假币的犯罪分子视为生成器。一开始，犯罪分子会首先向警察展示一张假币。警察识别出该假币，并向犯罪分子反馈哪些地方是假的。接着，根据警察的反馈，犯罪分子改进工艺，制作一张更逼真的假币给警方检查。这时警方再反馈，犯罪分子再改进工艺。不断重复这一过程，直到警察识别不出真假，那么模型就训练成功了。  \n",
    "\n",
    "GAN的变体非常多，我们就以深度卷积生成对抗网络（Deep Convolutional GAN，DCGAN）为例，自动生成 MNIST 手写体数字。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 判别器：\n",
    "判别器的作用是判断一个模型生成的图像和真实图像比，有多逼真。它的基本结构就是如下图所示的卷积神经网络（Convolutional Neural Network，CNN）。对于 MNIST 数据集来说，模型输入是一个 28x28 像素的单通道图像。Sigmoid 函数的输出值在 0-1 之间，表示图像真实度的概率，其中 0 表示肯定是假的，1 表示肯定是真的。与典型的 CNN 结构相比，这里去掉了层之间的 max-pooling。这里每个 CNN 层都以 LeakyReLU 为激活函数。而且为了防止过拟合，层之间的 dropout 值均被设置在 0.4-0.7 之间，模型结构如下：\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/Discriminator.jpg\" alt=\"FAO\" width=\"500\"></center> \n",
    "ReLU激活函数极为f(x)=alpha * x for x < 0, f(x) = x for x>=0。alpha是一个小的非零数。\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/LeakyRelu.png\" alt=\"FAO\" width=\"200\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 生成器：\n",
    "生成器的作用是合成假的图像，其基本机构如下图所示。图中，我们使用了卷积的倒数，即[转置卷积（transposed convolution）](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic)，从 100 维的噪声（满足 -1 至 1 之间的均匀分布）中生成了假图像。这里我们采用了模型前三层之间的上采样来合成更逼真的手写图像。在层与层之间，我们采用了批量归一化的方法来平稳化训练过程。以 ReLU 函数为每一层结构之后的激活函数。最后一层 Sigmoid 函数输出最后的假图像。第一层设置了 0.3-0.5 之间的 dropout 值来防止过拟合。\n",
